# Data Visualization of Psychological Disorders through Machine Learning

This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including regression, clustering, SVM, Stochastic Gradient Descent, confusion matrix, one-hot encoder, and soft encoder, to analyze and visualize psychological disorders in humans. The dataset is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) and covers a range of factors such as health reports, sleep habits, alcohol consumption, and personal and professional details.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to understand and visualize human behavior based on a comprehensive dataset. The data encompasses various aspects of individuals' lives, including health, sleep patterns, alcohol consumption, marital status, gender, and the presence of heart or brain diseases. Through machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify patterns and relationships in the data to determine the most frequent causes of suicide.

## Key Features

- **Regression Analysis:** Predictive modeling to understand the relationships between different variables.
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar individuals based on behavioral patterns.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines):** Classifying individuals into categories based on their characteristics.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent:** Optimizing machine learning models for better accuracy.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Evaluating the performance of classification models.
- **One-Hot Encoder:** Encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.
- **Soft Encoder:** Utilizing encoding techniques for improved model performance.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The dataset is obtained from WHO, covering a range of factors influencing human behavior.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and organizing the data for machine learning tasks.
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.

3. **Training and Testing:**
   - Applying various machine learning algorithms to train and test the data.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

4. **Combining Results:**
   - Combining results from different models to obtain a comprehensive understanding.

5. **Final Analysis:**
   - Performing additional machine learning algorithms on combined results to determine the most frequent cause of suicide.
